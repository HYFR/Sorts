# O(n**2) Sorts v2

First coding assignment of the quarter where I have created algorithms for bubble, insertion and select sorts.

The star emoji represents completed code.

All that is left is to create tests and split functions into different files.

## Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a simple, sorting algorithm that iterates through a list to be sorted, comparing each pair adjacent to each other and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The iteration through the list is repeated until all the numbers have been listed according to the algorithm. :star2:

## Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a simple, sorting algorthim that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. This algorithm iterates through a list, removes one element, and finds the location where it belongs. This process continues until the list is sorted. :star2:

## Merge Sort
The merge sort divides an unsorted list into smaller units, then compares each element with its adjacent counterpart and merged together. The sort iterates through this process until all the elements are sorted. :star2:
